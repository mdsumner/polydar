# polydar

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

A very raw port of [polylidar](https://github.com/JeremyBYU/polylidar) to try
building an R package with it. 

What I did: 

* clone polylidar
* cp polylidar/polylidar -R polydar/
* cp polylidar/examples polydar/examples
* mv polydar/polylidar polydar/src
* create polydar/Makevars
* cp polydar/examples/cpp/simple-2d.cpp polydar/src/simple-2d-polydar.cpp

and modified that to call what was main from R as `IntegerVector polydar`. 

Set up all the Rcpp and roxygen stuffs. 

WIP
